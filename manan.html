              <p>
                I grew up in a lower middle-class family in Delhi, where I faced
                challenges with both academics and mental health during my early
                years. The traditional emphasis on rote memorization for exams
                often left me perplexed, as I found more joy in reading and
                learning beyond the confines of the curriculum. It was not until
                after college, when I successfully navigated the Google
                interview process in 2005, that my circumstances began to
                change.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Google, I found an environment that allowed me to thrive. I
                dedicated my early years to absorbing as much knowledge as
                possible about digital marketing and technology, which fueled my
                professional growth. Over time, I progressed to managing large,
                diverse teams across more than 15 countries in the Americas,
                Europe, and Asia Pacific. In 2011, I relocated to Singapore to
                lead a new function for Google Ads, managing large teams of more
                than 50 people delivering multi-million dollar impact. Despite
                these achievements, I remained mindful of my humble beginnings,
                and the persistent sense of imposter syndrome often made me
                question whether my success was real, fearing that I might be
                exposed as less capable than others believed.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my time at Google, I met my life partner, Sonam. Early in
                our relationship, we visited her hometown of Kalimpong in North
                Bengal. It was here that we encountered local children and
                witnessed a profound lack of self-confidence, similar to what I
                had experienced in my own childhood. We observed that children
                in this small town had limited exposure to opportunities, which
                hindered their confidence and aspirations. Even the adults we
                met seemed to believe that significant accomplishments were
                beyond their reach.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we delved deeper, we realized that while education was
                accessible in these smaller towns, job-ready skills were often
                lacking, leaving many with limited options—either taking up
                small jobs or, for women, adhering to traditional roles. This
                stark reality resonated with me, reminding me of an alternate
                path my life could have taken if not for the opportunities I
                received at Google.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sonam and I made a life-changing decision: instead of having
                children of our own, we would dedicate ourselves to supporting
                underprivileged children, helping them acquire the skills needed
                to build successful careers. This commitment led to the
                establishment of the Ahora Foundation in 2016. As of 2024, the
                Ahora Foundation supports 12 children. After two decades at
                Google, I made the decision to leave my corporate career and
                return to India to fully devote myself to this cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our vision for the Ahora Foundation extends beyond the
                foundation itself. While our primary focus is on creating a
                model to enhance the employability of children, we aim to extend
                the impact of our work to all underprivileged children in India.
                We are developing products and programs designed to invest in
                their education and provide them with a fighting chance to build
                meaningful careers. Our ultimate goal is to positively influence
                the lives of millions of children, starting with the critical
                foundation of education.
