          <p>
            Ahora Foundation is a story of a gap, a story of a need, and a story
            of equality. Our founders noticed early on that children from remote
            areas around Kalimpong were not as confident as their peers in the
            cities. While they were enrolled into schools, hardly any of them
            were consistent with their attendance. Getting good grades to make
            them ready for the competitive world was out of the question. This
            opportunity disparity was even more evident amongst girls due to
            gender discrimination, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation
            throughout their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The founders saw this as a problem they could address by going back
            to the basics, that is, a learning that balances core education with
            life- and job-relevant skills building. But first, these girls
            needed a safe environment, access to nutritious food, and care
            givers, who were invested about their emotional, physical, and
            mental wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story of the Ahora Foundation is a story of these young girls,
            with numerous hidden capabilities, but are not in the right
            environment to succeed in their lives. Our effort is to offer a
            speedy transition of at-risk children from lives of abuse, neglect,
            and discrimination, to a life that offers them avenues to build self
            awareness and make well-informed, sustainable choices for their
            future. Ahora girls go to regular school. When they return home, the
            facilities supplements this with education through technology,
            vocational skills workshops, and access to sports, all of which
            amplifies personality development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ahora Foundation is not just a story of hope. It is an action-biased
            journey to empower today's tiny voices to grow into strong voices of
            the near future.
