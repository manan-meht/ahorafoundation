              <p>
                My life has been a tapestry woven with threads of diverse
                experiences. I have navigated the corporate world, dipped my
                toes into the fashion industry, and have found joy in teaching
                English to international students to boost their employability.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few years before the pandemic, in need of a wellbeing reset, I
                planned a month-long sabbatical from work in my hometown
                Kalimpong. This was a place steeped in cherished childhood
                memories. But, it was during this extended stay when I was
                confronted with the harsh realities of life in the neighboring
                areas. The extraordinary resilience of the local women juggling
                responsibilities, often in the face of huge individual
                sacrifices, profoundly impacted me. Their strength in adversity
                inspired me. It also made me wonder what they would have done
                differently if they didn’t have to sacrifice so much on a daily
                basis. I began to reflect on the power of privilege in a much
                deeper sense. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It brought a wave of recollections of how I have hustled through
                a lot of unexpected turns in my 20s. Numerous times where I had
                to start from scratch, patiently rebuild, navigate every
                setback, take care of myself, create space to celebrate the mini
                milestones, and most importantly, protect myself from the
                pressures of not always meeting the world’s expectations of what
                success should look like. Even in such trying times, I was
                fortunate to have known how to access opportunities to keep
                moving forward towards self development and mental wellbeing.
                This, unfortunately, is a luxury denied to many. This
                realization fueled a growing sense of responsibility. 
              </p>

                Co-founding Ahora was a natural progression. It was a decision
                to channel my experience into creating a platform for
                underprivileged girls to tap into their fullest potential, in
                the way they choose to. To discover appropriate techniques for
                more self awareness and confidence. To find ways to create
                opportunities for themselves in an environment that may continue
                to limit them. We are told what to do and why, but rarely do we
                understand the how. This is a critical gap.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ahora, to me, is more than just an organization; it is a
                personal mission. My journey to write my story and be my own
                strongest advocate continues. And, I hope I can empower the
                young voices of Ahora Girls to identify their strengths and own
                their journey from early on itself.
