              <p>
                As a child, I was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which
                left me with full-body paralysis. Due to limited resources and
                access to information, my diagnosis and path to recovery took
                longer (years) than an average patient in a city (months).
                Growing up with this physical challenge has undoubtedly shaped
                my resilience and perspective. On top of this, acts of
                unconditional love, championing, inclusion, intentionality, and
                action form the core essence of who I am today. To know me, you
                have to know about my heroes.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unconditional love: My sister, Yaki, grew up supporting her
                  ailing sibling. An evening is etched in my memory when my
                  physiotherapy session ran very late. Mom and I returned home
                  way beyond my sister’s feeding time. I remember seeing her
                  little body propped against the window, staring into the dark
                  outdoors, searching for the glimmer of our scooter headlight.
                  The moment she saw us arrive, she shrieked in happiness. I got
                  a hug first, and then she pranced around like a happy pup
                  until Mom was ready to feed her. This pretty much sums up our
                  childhood to teen years. I was always top of mind for the
                  family. Every task and decision revolved around how to make me
                  most comfortable. Her childhood became a shadow of my
                  priorities but she never resented me. She showed me how to
                  lean in with all the goodness I can offer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Championing: My grand aunt taught me the power of focusing on
                  strengths. While watching a football match, I commented on how
                  I wished I could run fast like him. She replied - “you may not
                  run like him on the field but your mind runs faster than all
                  of them.” She always encouraged me to focus on my achievements
                  and less on where I fall short in comparison to others. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inclusion: During a school sports season, my batch captain
                  walks up to me and assigns me the performance tracker
                  register. He tells me - “you know the participants, and you
                  are good at taking notes. Help me with detailed entries so
                  that I can track who needs more training.” Suddenly I was part
                  of the event and not just a sad spectator. He found a way for
                  me to contribute in my unique way. It’s one of my happiest
                  memories from school. I doubt he even realized how his simple
                  action meant the world to me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intentionality: I have worked for almost two decades at
                  Google. From the early days of search advertising to now
                  leading a team that works on AI offerings in our product
                  ecosystem, I have been lucky to learn from the best. A key
                  theme that defines my learning is intentionality. It
                  translated to how I started creating time beyond my core job
                  for coaching, mentoring, and facilitating globally recognized
                  workshops like #IamRemarkable. It led to our discipline of
                  working on weekends on Ahora tasks and dedicating  % of our
                  income to self-fund the Foundation.

                  Action: Kal kare so aaj kar, aaj kare so ab. Pal me praleya
                  hoyegi, bahuri karegi kab - Saint Kabir Das.My husband, Manan,
                  lives and breathes this. It’s the reason behind how much he
                  gets done, how he makes each day count. While I had a clear
                  vision of how I want to give back to our community, it wasn’t
                  until Manan came in with his game plan that Ahora Foundation
                  launched. I remember being overwhelmed and in analysis
                  paralysis on how to start a non-profit while having a
                  full-time job and living in another country. It was his bias
                  for action that compelled us to see the value in helping even
                  one child instead of just daydreaming about building for a
                  thousand someday.

              <p>
                A simple act of kindness, support, and action that you may not
                even think much about can have a butterfly effect in someone’s
                life. I am grateful for being on the receiving end. It is
                important that I pay it forward. This is what motivates me about
                the Ahora Foundation journey.
